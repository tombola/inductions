The Dyslexia Skills team provides one-to-one advice and guidance to students who have identified as having dyslexia
We can help you develop new approaches to aid your studies. Particular skills you may want to improve in might be:
 
* Effective study skills for YOU
* Clarifying thinking
* Decoding briefs
* Managing workload
* Reading effectively for research
* Improving memory
* Using Assistive Technology

You might suspect you have dyslexia, but may not be sure...

The Dyslexia Skills team will be running sessions to establish individual learning styles during the Falmouth Induction week. This knowledge will help you in your studies. The team will also be checking for indicators of dyslexia and will advise you about these.
